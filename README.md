## üöÄ About the Project

**android-tools-web** is a Kotlin-based Android web server that allows you to easily execute **Fastboot** and **ADB** commands through a web interface. It provides a simple, practical, and fast solution for developers who want to manage devices directly from their browser.

> **Note:** This project is still under active development. Bugs and missing features may exist.

## üß© Project Roadmap

* [x] **Basic ADB / Fastboot Integration**
  Established the core infrastructure for communicating with Android devices using ADB and Fastboot. Enables basic command execution and device recognition.

* [x] **Fastboot Reboot API**
  Implemented a REST API endpoint to reboot devices in fastboot mode directly through the backend service.

* [x] **Fastboot Device Saving**
  Added functionality to save fastboot device information such as serial number, codename, unlock status, and device type into the database.

* [ ] **ADB Reboot API**
  Developed a REST API to trigger device reboots using ADB, allowing remote reboot functionality.

* [ ] **ADB ROM Installation**
  To be implemented: ability to install custom ROMs or image files (ZIP or IMG) to a device using ADB commands via the API.

* [ ] **Fastboot Image Flashing**
  To be implemented: flash specific partitions (e.g., boot, system, recovery) using Fastboot and uploaded image files.

* [ ] **Fastboot Image Removal**
  To be implemented: remove or erase specific device partitions (e.g., userdata, cache) through Fastboot via API.

* [ ] **Web Interface Prototype**
  A basic web UI will be developed to allow users to view connected devices, send commands, and monitor activity through a user-friendly interface.

* [ ] **Predefined Command Execution**
  Frequently used ADB and Fastboot commands will be available through predefined buttons or shortcuts in the API and frontend.

* [ ] **Command History Logging**
  A full history of executed commands will be recorded per device and user, with timestamps for audit and debugging purposes.

* [ ] **User Authentication & Access Control**
  Implement secure login and authorization with token-based authentication and role-based access control to restrict features.

* [ ] **Multi-Device Support**
  Add support for managing and interacting with multiple connected devices simultaneously, with proper device isolation.

* [ ] **Advanced Error Handling**
  Improve error detection and handling for device communication issues, with clear error responses, logging, and graceful fallbacks.
